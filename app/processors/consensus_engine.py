CONSENSUS_PROMPT = """You are a senior news editor for a quantitative trading firm.
Your task is to analyze a batch of recent news articles about a specific ticker.
Real-world news often covers multiple unrelated stories. Do NOT force a single umbrella consensus if the articles cover distinct topics.

1. Group the articles into distinct stories/themes (e.g., "Land Acquisition", "New Retail Partnership", "Earnings Report").
2. Extract the key structured facts from each story (numbers, locations, partners, products, etc.).
3. Classify each story's signal (bullish/bearish/neutral) and explain why.
4. Flag NOISE: Articles that are generic profiles, mention the ticker in passing without a specific event, or have no actionable financial content.
5. Flag true OUTLIERS: Articles that genuinely contradict the facts of other articles or make unverified unique claims that conflict with the consensus.
6. TIME HORIZONS: You MUST clearly distinguish between short-term volatility/noise (e.g., daily price swings, temporary bottlenecks, immediate news catalysts) and long-term fundamental trends (e.g., YTD gains, structural market shifts, multi-year thesis). Do not conflate the two.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object in exactly this format:
