"""
Post-Cycle Learning -- Extract reusable lessons from trading decisions.

Runs after each ticker's decision in decision_engine.py.
Uses a single vLLM call to extract a lesson, then writes to TradingMemory.

When to learn (not everything is worth learning):
  - High-conviction decisions (confidence >= 85) -- worth remembering the pattern
  - Low-conviction decisions (confidence <= 35) -- worth remembering the confusion
  - Escalated decisions (Config C -> D debate) -- worth remembering the conflict
  - Everything in between is skipped (noise)

Rules:
- Max 400 chars
- Start with [TICKER] [TIER] (e.g., [NVDA] [HIGH] or [AAPL] [LOW])
- Include the specific indicator values that drove the decision
- If nothing is worth remembering, respond with exactly: SKIP
Examples of good lessons:
  [NVDA] [HIGH] RSI < 35 + institutional buying > $2B = strong BUY signal (worked 3x)
  [XOM] [LOW] Oil z-score > 1.5 preceded 2 consecutive earnings beats
  [AAPL] [MEDIUM] Congressional sells within 30d of earnings = reliable warning"""
