"""
Database Curator — Background hygiene agent for unstructured data.

Responsibilities:
1. Scans `news_articles`, `reddit_posts`, `youtube_transcripts`.
2. Marks duplicates and low-effort spam as 'merged', 'duplicate', or 'spam'.
3. Generates high-density summaries for rows missing `llm_summary` using the
   Jetson collector node to ensure data is robust and detailed before debate.

Designed to be run as an independent loop or pipeline step.
