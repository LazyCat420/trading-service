"""
Watchlist Health Scoring Engine — tracks data quality + analysis quality
per ticker and computes a 0-100 health score.

Scoring formula (0-100):
  Data Richness   25%  — news + reddit + youtube article counts
  Data Freshness  15%  — penalty for zero_news_streaks
  Collection Rel. 10%  — penalty for collection failures
  Confidence      20%  — avg confidence from decision engine
  Action Signals  15%  — BUY/SELL show tradability; HOLD-only = low
  Tenure Bonus    15%  — grace period for new tickers

Tiers:
  strong   80-100   High data density, actionable signals
  healthy  60-79    Decent data, some signals
  weak     30-59    Low data, mostly HOLDs
  critical  0-29    Zero data, repeated failures → purge candidate
  new       n/a     Within grace period (< WATCHLIST_GRACE_CYCLES)
