Collection Scheduler — Smart freshness checks for all data sources.

Prevents re-scraping data that hasn't changed. Each source has a
different refresh cadence based on when new data actually appears:

  Source            Cadence         Why
  ──────────────    ──────────      ─────────────────────────────────
  SEC 13F           Quarterly       Filed 45 days after quarter end
  Congress trades   Daily           New disclosures appear daily
  News (Finnhub)    6 hours         Articles published throughout day
  News (RSS)        6 hours         Feeds update frequently
  YouTube           12 hours        New videos posted daily
  Reddit            6 hours         Posts flow constantly
  Fundamentals      Daily           Price-derived metrics change daily
  Technicals        Daily           Technical indicators recalc daily
  Price history     Daily           Market hours only
  Commodities       6 hours         Trade nearly 24/7

Usage:
