"""
Action Gate — Normalizes trading actions based on position state.

The bot should never produce HOLD for a ticker it doesn't own.
This module provides a single reusable function that enforces this
invariant at every layer of the pipeline.

Rules:
    Not held → HOLD is meaningless → remap to SELL (conservative: don't enter)
    Held → BUY is meaningless → remap to HOLD (already own it)
    PASS → conservative default based on position state
