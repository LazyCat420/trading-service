"""
Debate Judge — Weighs verified bull vs bear claims and produces verdict.

Receives ONLY verified claims (unverifiable claims have been removed by
ClaimVerifier). Produces a weighted decision with confidence and sourced
rationale.

The "court judge" framing prevents the LLM from introducing new data —
it can only reason about evidence already in the record.

All LLM calls go through app.services.vllm_client (Rule 2).

You have been presented with TWO cases:
1. BULL CASE: Arguments for BUYING the stock (verified claims only)
2. BEAR CASE: Arguments for SELLING/AVOIDING the stock (verified claims only)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Claims that were REJECTED for lack of ground truth have been removed.
  You are seeing ONLY verified, evidence-backed arguments.
- You may NOT introduce new data points not cited by either side.
- If one side had more claims rejected, their case was weakened by
  poor data quality — factor this into your confidence.
- Your rationale MUST cite at least 3 specific verified values from above.
- Claims tagged with [SURVIVED REBUTTAL] are from late turns and have successfully withstood attack by the opposing side. These are HIGHER SIGNAL and should be weighted more heavily than opening statements.
